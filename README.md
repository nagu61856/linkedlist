# React Linked List

This React component provides a basic implementation of a singly linked list with interactive methods.

## Features

1. **`prepend(data)`**: Adds a node with the given data to the head of the list.
2. **`pop()`**: Removes the last node from the list.
3. **`removeAt(index)`**: Removes the node at the specified index.
4. **`insertAt(index, data)`**: Inserts a node with the given data at the specified index.

## Usage

    Click the "Prepend" button and enter the value you want to add at the head of the list.

2. **Pop Last Node**

    Click the "Pop" button to remove the last node from the list.

3. **Remove Node at Specific Position**

    Click the "Remove At" button and enter the index of the node you want to remove.

4. **Insert Node at Specific Position**

    Click the "Insert At" button, enter the index where you want to insert the node, and provide the value for the new node.

5. **Displaying the List**

    The current state of the linked list will be displayed as an unordered list below the buttons.
